# Flu-Analysis-in-R
Using twitter data, we map out the areas within the continental USA which have higher number of mentions of flu related topics. We then compare this to the actual flu map of the CDC and compare the two, and check if our hypothesis was validated.
We use the rtweet library for mining the tweets, ggmap for plotting the heatmap, RJSONIO to deal with JSON objects, and native R for all other data munging.
